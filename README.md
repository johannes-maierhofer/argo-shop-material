# Argo Shop Material

> **The main idea for creating this project is to have a simple Angular app, using Material Design, where to try out some good practices. It works as a frontend for the [ArgoShop backend](https://github.com/johannes-maierhofer/argo-shop-backend/).**

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Techniques being used

- Global error handling.
- Http interceptors
- Notifications via Material SnackBar
- Module organization: Core and Shared module, organize features into modules. 

## How to run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
